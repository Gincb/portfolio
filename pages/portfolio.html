Instead of facing stress from face-to-face interviews, which most of the time stops people from speaking their mind and express themselves well, with video-resumes people could sell their skills without any performance anxiety.</p>

            <p>The form with validation apart from meeting the basic requirements, for example, does the email have @ symbol and if the user is 18 years old, we also added additional features to it, checking what kind of credit card is used by picking out the first digit of the number and based on the written zip code, what is their KEA campus, making sure it’s 4 digits long.</p>

            <h2><span class="highlight">Main</span> goal</h2>
            <p>Working in groups, creating an onboarding site to present in an exhibition, dedicated to international students settling in Denmark, explaining the most important aspect about moving in to Denmark to be a student at KEA through gamification. The project includes adding key features to the game experience such as levels, rewards, point system, leaderboard etc and each panel mostly contains our own drawn illustrations and animations.</p>
            <p>Main focus of our website – create a platform where “soon-to-be” students are looking for a study program they would like to get to know more about before choosing their path. </p>
            <h2><span class="highlight">Achieve</span>ments</h2>
            <p>Putting in the potential usage of everything we have learned so far – using advanced CSS and JS, creating our own illustrations and animations to create a gamified onboarding website.</p>
            <p>Addressing the concern of potential future KEA students and others that are still looking for their path. Creating a synergized team environment, picking out individual roles and assigning tasks using a virtual Kanban chart, where we keep updating each other on made progress. Before the final product is made, we drew a storyboard for each scene for the onboarding story – describing each set, plot, dramaturgical and interactive elements.</p>
            <p>Our website focuses on potential KEA students, addressing the concern they might have – what a week at school might look like if they were a student at KEA. The main idea is that this would be a series of showing what a week looks like in each program, but we only focused on the MMD program. Throughout the game, as one of the features for the gamified onboarding experience, the user can collect KEA stickers, hidden in different scenes.</p>

            <p>Building a campaign website for a customer, prompting users to participate in volunteering or raising awareness of food waste. Film and edit a video reflecting the campaigns primary goal and idea, engaging users to participate in Foodsharing and stop food waste.</p>

            <p>By assigning individual tasks and working together in a group creating a campaign website for a company, getting a direct experience trying to fulfill customers wishes and following their design guidelines. </p>
            <p>Sketching and planning the campaign video by creating a storyboard, summarizing each scene and getting to know more about compositions, shot types, angles, audio etc. to get the best out of every set, planning and executing. Our video focuses on a more storytelling, main character is the cabbage, who imagines itself being in a relationship with a man, who bought it. By the end of the story, the man leaves the cabbage untouched for too long, it gets spoiled and ends up in the trash. That’s why our main campaign slogan is #LittleHeartbreaks.</p>
            <p>In customers pitch, we focus on delivering our campaign message and concept for the client, explaining the meaning of the video, different website design decisions followed by guidelines. Explain how we deal with food waste ourselves and trying to raise awareness by giving an example of „Compound Effect“ – taking care of our grocories and food for 15 minutes everyday – would that make an impact?</p>
